In truth, Watson is not actually a computer but a set of algorithms and APIs, and since winning TV fame (and a $1 million prize) IBM has put it to use tackling tough problems in every industry from healthcare to finance. Most recently, IBM has announced several new partnerships which aim to take things even further, and put its cognitive capabilities to use solving a whole new range of problems around the world.",
